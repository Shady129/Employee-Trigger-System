# 👨‍💼 Employee Trigger System (SQL Server)

A professional SQL Server project that demonstrates how to implement
database-level auditing using Triggers.

This system automatically logs all INSERT, UPDATE, and DELETE
operations performed on the Employees table.

---

## 🎯 Project Goal

Build a clean and structured auditing system that:

- Tracks employee salary changes
- Logs inserted employees
- Logs deleted employees
- Stores old and new values
- Demonstrates real-world Trigger usage
